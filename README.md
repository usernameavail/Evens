# Evens

Made in assembly with MIPS.

Prompts the user and read an integer value, acting as the number of values to be entered. If the value is not between 1 and 10, prints an error message and exits. Then prompts the user and read each value entered. Then prints values that were even, separated by commas. If one or more values were even, prints the average of the even values.
